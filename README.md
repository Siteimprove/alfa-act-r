# Comparing Alfa with ACT-Rules and WAI test cases

[Alfa](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa) is an automated accessibility checker developed by [Siteimprove](https://www.siteimprove.com/). 

This repository runs Alfa against the official test cases from ACT Rules and WCAG 2 test rules.

Because the ACT-R Community Group is in the process of moving its website from self-hosted (`"old"`) to the WAI website (`"new"`), we currently track two sets of test cases. 

Neither Alfa nor Siteimprove are endorsed by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/), the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) or the ACT rules Community group.

## Installation

```shell
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

Installing Alfa packages need authentication to the Github repository for the `@siteimprove` scope.

## Usage

### Update test cases

To download the latest version of the test cases, build the project then:

```shell
$ yarn fixtures [old | new]
```

If non argument is provided, both will be downloaded.

### Generate report

To run Alfa against the test cases:

```shell
$ yarn test
```

This generates a report for the set of test cases. Committing the report and pushing it upstream will update the implementation report on the corresponding website.

Using `yarn strict` instead of `yarn test` will fail the tests (and generate errors) for benign mismatches (e.g. "Passed" vs "Inapplicable"). This can be useful for investigating and marking these correctlyâ€¦

In order to test the old test cases, use

```shell
$ yarn ava "**/old*" [-- --strict]
```

this is mostly deprecated now and only the new test cases should matter.
